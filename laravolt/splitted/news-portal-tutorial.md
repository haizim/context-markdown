====================

This tutorial guides you through building a complete news portal application similar to popular news sites but with a simplified architecture. You'll implement features such as content management, user roles, comments, and analytics.

Project Overview
----------------

In this tutorial, we'll build a news portal application with both an admin panel and a public-facing website. The project will use Laravolt's built-in features to accelerate development while still providing a comprehensive learning experience.

Application Specifications
--------------------------

### Actors (User Roles)

The application will involve four distinct user roles:

1.  **Admin** - Manages the platform and has access to all features
2.  **Writer** - Creates and manages news content
3.  **Member** - Registered users who can interact with content
4.  **Guest** - Anonymous visitors with limited permissions

### User Stories

Technical Concepts
------------------

### Data Models

The application will use four primary models:

1.  **User** - Stores account information for all user types
2.  **Post** - Represents news articles
3.  **Topic** - Categorizes news articles
4.  **Comment** - Stores user comments on articles

### Relationships

The application will implement these relationships:

*   Member is-a User
*   Writer is-a Member
*   Writer has many Posts
*   Member has many Comments
*   Post belongs to Topic
*   Post belongs to Writer
*   Comment belongs to Member

### Technical Requirements

*   Admin panel built with Laravolt
*   Public-facing website built with TailwindCSS
*   CRUD operations for Post and Topic using AutoCRUD
*   Dashboard charts created with Laravolt Chart
