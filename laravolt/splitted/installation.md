### Checking PHP Extensions

There are several ways to check which PHP extensions are installed on your system:

1.  **Using Terminal/Command Line**:
    
    Bash
    
        php -m
    
    This command displays a list of all installed PHP extensions.
    
2.  **Using a PHP Script**: Create a file named `phpinfo.php` with the following content:
    
    PHP
    
        <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    
    Place this file in your web server directory and access it via browser.
    
3.  **Using Composer in a Laravolt Project**:
    
    Bash
    
        composer check-platform-reqs
    
    This command checks whether your system meets all platform requirements from installed packages.
    

### Installing PHP Extensions

Here's how to install commonly used PHP extensions on various operating systems:

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:

Bash

    sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install php8.2-bcmath php8.2-curl php8.2-xml php8.2-gd php8.2-mbstring php8.2-zip# Replace 8.2 with your PHP version

#### On CentOS/RHEL:

Bash

    sudo yum install php-bcmath php-curl php-xml php-gd php-mbstring php-zip

#### On macOS (using Homebrew):

Bash

    brew install php# PHP from Homebrew usually includes most required extensions

#### On Windows (XAMPP/WAMP):

Most extensions are enabled by default. To enable additional extensions:

1.  Open the `php.ini` file (usually located in the PHP installation folder)
2.  Find the line containing the extension name (e.g., `;extension=gd`)
3.  Remove the semicolon (`;`) at the beginning of the line to enable the extension
4.  Restart the web server

### Common Troubleshooting

1.  **"Call to undefined function" error**: This error message typically indicates that a required PHP extension is not installed or enabled.
    
2.  **Error during Composer installation**:
    
    Bash
    
        Problem 1    - laravolt/laravolt requires ext-gd * -> the requested PHP extension gd is missing from your system.
    
    Solution: Install the requested extension using the instructions above.
    
3.  **Image or avatar errors**: If image manipulation features aren't working, make sure the GD extension is properly installed:
    
    Bash
    
        php -m | grep gd
    
    If there's no output, the GD extension is not installed.
    
4.  **Checking PHP version**:
    
    Bash
    
        php --version
    
    Make sure you're using PHP 8.2 or higher for Laravolt.
    

Installing Laravolt
-------------------

**Laravolt** is a package, so you must already have a Laravel application set up before installation. For Laravel installation, refer to the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master#installing-laravel). Ensure your configuration is correct and the default Laravel page is accessible in your browser.

Once your Laravel application is ready, follow these steps:

### 1\. Install the Package

Bash

    composer require laravolt/laravolt

### 2\. Set Up Laravolt

Several files need to be generated and customized for Laravolt to run properly. Simply run the following command:

Bash

    php artisan laravolt:install

### 3\. Migrate the Database

Next, don't forget to run the migrations (fresh, because Laravel installation auto migrate itself):

Bash

    php artisan migrate:fresh

### 4\. Add an Admin User

To add a user with admin role, run the interactive command:

Bash

    php artisan laravolt:admin

Or, for a quicker method without answering questions one by one:

Bash

    php artisan laravolt:admin Administrator [email protected] secret

### 5\. Local Development

As known, running a PHP application requires a **_web server_**. Here are several ways to run Laravolt in a local development environment:

#### Using Laravel's PHP Built-in Server

The simplest way to run a Laravel application is with the development server via PHP's built-in server. Run the following command:

Bash

    php artisan serve

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

#### Using Composer Scripts

Since Laravel 11, there's a `dev` script that can be used to run multiple services simultaneously. If you're using Laravel 11.28 or above, simply run:

Bash

    composer dev

This script will run multiple services (Vite, queue worker, logs, web server) in a single terminal.

#### Alternative Local Development Tools

If you need a more comprehensive development server, try these alternatives:

1.  [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) - Official development server from Laravel
2.  [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) - Recommended for Windows, all needs are integrated
3.  [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) - Popular for beginners
4.  [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en) - Alternative for Windows
5.  [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet) - Specifically for macOS
6.  [Laradock](https://laradock.io/) - Complete Docker solution for the Laravel ecosystem

### 6\. Log in to the Application

After the server is running, access the application through your browser and log in using the admin credentials you created earlier:

*   URL: http://localhost:8000/auth/login
*   Email: the email you entered when running the `laravolt:admin` command (default: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection))
*   Password: the password you entered when running the `laravolt:admin` command (default: secret)

Congratulations, you've successfully installed and launched Laravolt!
