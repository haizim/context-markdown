Creating Authorized Menu
========================

Implementing authorized menus in your Laravolt application ensures that users can only see and access menu items they have permission for. This creates a cleaner user interface and enhances your application's security.

Overview
--------

Menu authorization in Laravolt involves three key components:

*   Defining permissions
*   Connecting menus to permissions
*   Implementing access control checks in your code

By following this approach, you can create a dynamic permission system where administrators can manage access control without requiring code changes.

Basic Implementation
--------------------

### 1\. Defining Permissions

First, create an enum class to store your application's permissions:

PHP

    <?phpnamespace App\Enums;use BenSampo\Enum\Enum;final class Permission extends Enum{    const DASHBOARD_VIEW = 'dashboard.view';    // Add other permissions as needed}

After defining the permissions, synchronize them with the database:

Bash

    php artisan laravolt:sync-permission

This command registers all defined permissions in your database, making them available for assignment to roles.

### 2\. Connecting Menus and Permissions

Edit your menu configuration to specify required permissions:

PHP

    // config/laravolt/menu/app.phpreturn [    'App' => [        'menu' => [            'Dashboard' => [                'route' => ['dashboard'],                'active' => 'dashboard/*',                'icon'  => 'chart-bar',                'permissions' => [\App\Enums\Permission::DASHBOARD_VIEW],            ],        ],    ],];

This configuration will hide the Dashboard menu from users who don't have the `dashboard.view` permission.

### 3\. Implementing Access Control in Code

While permission-based menu visibility prevents users from seeing unauthorized menu items, you must also implement access control checks in your code to prevent direct URL access.

#### Route-level Authorization:

PHP

    // routes/web.phpRoute::get('dashboard', function () {    // show dashboard})->can(\App\Enums\Permission::DASHBOARD_VIEW);

#### Controller-level Authorization:

PHP

    public function index(){    $this->authorize(\App\Enums\Permission::DASHBOARD_VIEW);    // if authorized, show dashboard    return view('dashboard');}

Role Management
---------------

After defining permissions, administrators can assign them to roles through the administrative interface:

1.  Navigate to "System -> Roles" in the Laravolt admin panel
2.  Select a role you want to modify
3.  Check the permissions that should be granted to this role
4.  Save the changes

Best Practices
--------------

1.  **Use Descriptive Permission Names**: Create permission names that clearly describe the action and resource, like `users.create` or `reports.view`.
    
2.  **Group Related Permissions**: Organize permissions by feature or module for easier management.
    
3.  **Implement Defense in Depth**: Don't rely solely on menu visibility for security. Always implement proper authorization checks in controllers and routes.
    
4.  **Audit Access Regularly**: Periodically review role permissions to ensure they align with current business requirements.
    

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Common Issues

*   **Permissions Not Showing Up**: Make sure you've run `php artisan laravolt:sync-permission` after defining new permissions.
    
*   **Menu Still Visible Despite Permissions**: Check that the permission name in your config matches exactly with what's defined in your Enum class.
    
*   **Authorization Always Fails**: Verify that you've assigned the permission to the user's role and that the user is properly authenticated.
