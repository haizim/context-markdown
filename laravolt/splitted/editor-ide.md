Best Practices
--------------

### Consistent Formatting

Use tools like PHP CS Fixer or Laravel Pint to maintain consistent code formatting:

### Regular Updates

Keep your editor and extensions updated for the latest features and security fixes.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow. Both VS Code and PHPStorm offer shortcut cheat sheets:

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Extension Conflicts

If you experience performance issues or conflicts:

1.  Try disabling extensions one by one to identify the culprit
2.  Make sure extensions are compatible with your editor version
3.  Check for duplicate functionality across multiple extensions

### Performance Issues

If your editor becomes slow:

**VS Code**:

*   Increase available memory with the "--max-memory" flag

**PHPStorm**:

*   Increase memory allocation in Help > Edit Custom VM Options
*   Disable plugins you don't use
