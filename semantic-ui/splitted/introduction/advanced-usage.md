Additional integration paths for advanced users

## Custom Pipelines

#### Importing Gulp Tasks
You don't have to use [our gulp pipeline](/introduction/build-tools.html), just import the task into your own `gulpfile`

You can [fork this example project](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Example-External-Gulpfile) to see an example of how to import Semantic UI tasks into your project.
```javascript
var
  gulp  = require('gulp'),
  watch = require('./semantic/tasks/watch'),
  build = require('./semantic/tasks/build')
;
// import task with a custom task name
gulp.task('watch ui', watch);
gulp.task('build ui', build);
```

## Semantic.json Settings

#### Auto-Install
Running `npm install` normally will launch an interactive installer, to allow this installer to run without user interaction include a special flag `autoInstall: true`in your `semantic.json` file.
```javascript
{
// install will now automatically build your project files without user interaction
"autoInstall": true,

// these settings may be different
"base": "",
"paths": {
  "source": {
    "config": "src/theme.config",
    "definitions": "src/definitions/",
    "site": "src/site/",
    "themes": "src/themes/"
  },
  "output": {
    "packaged": "dist/",
    "uncompressed": "dist/components/",
    "compressed": "dist/components/",
    "themes": "dist/themes/"
  },
  "clean": "dist/"
},
"permission": false,
"rtl": false,
}
```

#### Right-to-left (RTL) Languages
Including the flag `rtl:true` will build Semantic UI using [RTLCSS](https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss).

To build both LTR and RTL versions use the flag `rtl: 'both'`
```javascript
{
// builds both LTR and RTL version
"rtl": "both",

// these settings may be different
"base": "",
"paths": {
  "source": {
    "config": "src/theme.config",
    "definitions": "src/definitions/",
    "site": "src/site/",
    "themes": "src/themes/"
  },
  "output": {
    "packaged": "dist/",
    "uncompressed": "dist/components/",
    "compressed": "dist/components/",
    "themes": "dist/themes/"
  },
  "clean": "dist/"
},
"permission": false,
}
```

## Prototyping with Semantic UI

#### Sketch Files
If you are looking to prototype layouts using [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) with Semantic UI check out [Semantic UI Sketch Files](https://github.com/guacamoly/semantic-ui-kit-for-sketch)

## Single Components

#### CDN Releases
Individual components are available on [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/semantic-ui)
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@<%= @getVersion() %>/dist/semantic.min.css">
```
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@<%= @getVersion() %>/dist/semantic.min.js"></script>
```
[View All CDN Files](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/semantic-ui)

#### Tagged Releases
Component repos are released on NPM and as tagged releases on GitHub.

Check the list of repos available under [Semantic Org](https://github.com/Semantic-Org?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=ui-) on GitHub

Each component's release notes will automatically update with the relevant notes for that component from the main release.
```
npm install semantic-ui-component
```

#### Server-Side Rendering
Individual components repos include an [auto-generated](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/tasks/admin/components/create.js) `index.js` file to simplify [`require`](http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/) use with NodeJS, for server-side rendering or with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).
```
npm install semantic-ui-dropdown
```
```javascript
var
  dropdown = require('semantic-ui-dropdown')
;
foo.dropdown();
```

## Importing LESS

#### LESS Only Distribution
A special distribution [Semantic-UI-LESS](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-LESS) is available for projects that use custom integrations and do not require our build tools.
> LESS source files are not prefixed, and will need to be run through [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) before being used

#### Importing Semantic
`semantic.less` is available in all releases as an entry point for importing multiple components from other LESS files.
```less
/* Import all components */
@import 'src/semantic';
```

#### Importing Components
If you need to import individual components, you should scope each import to avoid inheritance issues.
```less
/* Import specific components with scope */
& { @import 'src/definitions/elements/button'; }
& { @import 'src/definitions/elements/list'; }
```

## Running Docs Locally

#### Download Docs Server
The easiest way to get [Semantic UI docs](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-Docs/) is to clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-Docs.git
```

#### Install Dependencies
Semantic UI's documentation is written in [Docpad](http://www.docpad.org) an amazing static site generator built in NodeJS
```
cd docs/
npm install
```

#### A Note About Paths
Semantic UI's [build tools](introduction/build-tools.html) include two special commands `build-docs` and `serve-docs` for use with the documentation. These will pass changes from the ui/ folder directly to a live docs server.

These gulp tasks expect two sibling folders

*   ui/
    *   Files from semantic ui repo
*   docs/
    *   Files from docs repo

#### Build UI
The first time you run docs you will need to build the whole project once
```
cd ui/
gulp build-docs
```

#### Run Docpad Server
Docpad
```
cd docs/
# initial build may take several minutes
docpad run
```

#### Serve UI to Docs
You can then continue to make modifications to UI and "serve" these files to a live docs instance to see your changes immediately
```
cd ui/
gulp serve-docs
```

#### Hosted Docs
If you are managing your documentation you can automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using a built in [docpad gh-pages](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-ghpages) plugin

For more information about GitHub Pages, check out the [docs on GitHub](https://pages.github.com/)
```
docpad deploy-ghpages --env static
```

#### Custom Docs Paths
Doc task paths are specified in a file [`tasks/config/docs.js`](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/tasks/config/docs.js) and can be adjusted to use any folder set-up necessary for your project.
