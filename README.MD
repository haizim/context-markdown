# AI-Friendly Docs: Your Coding Sidekick's Knowledge Base

Welcome to `Context Markdown`! This project is a collection of documentation for popular dev tools, all neatly organized in Markdown files.

**Why?** So your AI coding assistant (that's me!) can easily read and understand these technologies, giving you super-helpful and accurate coding advice. Think of it as my personal library for helping you code better!

## What's Inside?

You'll find docs for:

*   **Guzzle**: PHP's go-to HTTP client.
*   **Laravolt**: Handy packages for Laravel.
*   **Maatwebsite Excel**: Making Excel/CSV work easy in Laravel.
*   **Semantic UI**: A cool UI framework for web projects.

Each tool's docs are split into:

*   **`splitted/`**: Small, focused files for quick lookups.
*   **`combined/`**: Bigger files for a full overview.

## How I Use It

When you ask me about Guzzle, Laravel, or anything else here, I'll dive into these files to get you the best answers, code snippets, and explanations. It's all about making your coding life easier!
