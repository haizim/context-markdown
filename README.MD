# `Context Markdown` Documentation Collection

This repository serves as a centralized collection of documentation for various popular PHP and JavaScript libraries/frameworks, primarily presented in Markdown format. The documentation for each project is organized into two distinct structures: a combined single file and a set of split, topic-specific files.

## Projects Included

*   **Guzzle**: A PHP HTTP client.
*   **Laravolt**: A collection of tools and packages for the Laravel framework.
*   **Maatwebsite/Laravel Excel**: A Laravel package for handling Excel imports and exports.
*   **Semantic UI**: A front-end development framework for creating responsive layouts.

## Structure

Each documented project has two main subdirectories:

*   `combined/`: Contains a single, comprehensive Markdown file that consolidates all documentation for that specific project.
*   `splitted/`: Contains individual Markdown files, each covering a specific topic or section of the project's documentation. This structure allows for easier navigation and focused reading.

## Usage

This repository can be used as a reference, for local documentation browsing, or as a source for processing and generating other documentation formats.
